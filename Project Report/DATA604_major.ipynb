    "Data and statistics is ubiquitous with sports. Whether it is tracking “Power Play Goals” in Hockey, “First Serve Points Won” in Tennis, or “Height and Reach” in Boxing, they all speak to how integral we believe these metrics to be to sports performances and outcomes. Despite the universality of data in sports in this decade, sports data and the question of how to use this data to inform decisions in sports is a fairly recent development. \n",
    "The formation of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) in 1971 was the first major sports-related institution that recognized the value of statistics in sports (DSG, 2021), but the concept of leveraging these statistics to make decisions around baseball (aptly named SABR-metrics) did not have any public or commercial recognition until the publication of Moneyball (Lewis, 2004) and the release of the film with the same name in 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basketball’s own Association for Professional Basketball Research was established in 1997, and subsequent APBR-metrics (a much less phonetically pleasing name) only made its way into the sport in 2004, with Dean Oliver being hired by the Seattle Supersonics, making him the first statistician hired in the NBA. The current “Statistical Player Value” is derived from “Minutes, Points, Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, and Turnovers” (Statistical Player Value, SPV - NBAstuffer, 2022). Other metrics such as “Offensive Rating”, “Defensive Rating”, and “Player Winning Percentage” (a combination of Offensive and Defensive Rating), have been developed to try to more accurately represent the game of basketball statistically. \n",
    "\n",
    "For us, being avid fans of the game, getting an opportunity to incorporate our love for the sport with this project made this work assignment engaging and a joy to challenge ourselves to work through problems and surpass our expectations.Within the scope of this engagement, each of us has explored basketball from an analytical point of view, tried to understand how certain statistics affect the general functioning of a team, the metrics required for winning games and general player related data sources. \n",
    "From a broader point of view that is from an overview of the NBA and the sport as a whole, our analysis gives minor insights into team and player behaviors and some important metrics to consider when considering building a team and the types of the players a NBA General Manager needs to consider while trying to build a Championship team.

    "The following example is one of the simpler examples of the scripts that we have built, the following code allows us to extract the sub header for contracts by finding all the “tr” attributes for the table-player-contracts. One of our questions deals with player injuries and if there is a relationship between player injuries and the contracts that the said players are currently employed on. For instance, Derrick Rose was one of the best young players when he was drafted in 2009, he won the MVP in 2011 (The youngest player to ever do so). Unfortunately he suffered an ACL tear in 2012 and since his career took a major dip from his peak. Since 2018, he has contracted with 22 lower body injuries. The goal here is to understand the kind of contract a injury prone player like him commands right now and to correlate it with other players with similar situations. \n",
    "In our SQL joining scripts, this data is being used similar to the above example, that is to join this data with injury related data to analyze the trends of how injuries affect  a player getting a contract, how relevant this high level observation is and whether there are any outliers to this."

    "The common thought is that the top teams will have the top players playing for them. Awards are one of the most sound metric to decide who these top players are. The purpose of getting this data is to understand how often the teams with the so-called “Best Players” actually end up having championship success. For example, the Boston Celtics went up against the Golden State warriors in the 2022 NBA Finals. The Celtics had the reigning Defensive Player of the Year. This award however became useless since Steph Curry from the Warriors averaged 31.1 points in the 6 game span and won the title. Looking into how relevant these award winners are can be good from a team building point of view."

It is statistically proven that scoring one-third of your shots from behind the 3-point line will yield a higher score than a player scoring half their shots from inside the line. In other words: Players Shooting as many 3-pointers as possible will lead to a higher score. But the question we would like to analyze is that have teams adopted their shooting style to shoot more 3-pointers? What is the general trend we see in teams scoring 3-pointers? After analyzing should we suggest coaches to make sure that players are well trained in taking 3-pointer shots?"

    "Continuing with the trend of team success and factors that affect that, we are now looking into the individual accomplishments of players who have been awarded by the one or more of the 5 core NBA awards which includes Most Valuable Player, Defensive PLayer of the Year, Most Improved Player, Six Man of the Year and Rookie of the Year. The purpose of this study is to understand the importance of having award winning players in your team and can these players lead a team to a successful record or championships. The initial inference based on personal understanding of the game would suggest having a top 5 player and players that win awards in your team lead you deep in the NBA playoffs. For instance Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetoukoumpo has been to the all star game 6 times, additionally he has won three of 5 core awards - MVP(x2), MIP, DPOY, moreever he was the star player of the Bucks when they won the championship in 2021. Is this trend consistent thoughout the NBA;s inception of awards or was this an isolated incident?"

Many players have been affected by the \"injury bug\" do this schedule and have lost alot of money over the years. Player like Derrick Rose, Greg Oden, Brandon Roy and Gordon Hayward have become the poster for the injured players in the NBA. Many calls for shortening the season have been on the trend over the past 10 years but to no avail. Here we are trying to analyze the average amount of money a player loses due to injuries and if the NBPA (National Basketball Player Association) has a legit evidence of metrics to support their plea to shorten the season."

The average salary for the 2022-2023 season has been computed and compared for both the categories and the results can be see from the above.It is easily concluded that players that have a high frequency of getting injured have ~50% contract value as compared to those who tend to remain fit or have lesser injuries."

The game allows 2 or more users to pick a team from a selection of current players with the 2022-2023 salary cap in mind. The teams built by the players can go head to head against each other through the Play button on the UI. The results of the head to head matchup is computed through the models built though Linear Regression, providing us with an agregated value of the net +/- statictic which represents the contributiion of each player while they are on court, this value is computed with deviation to introduce randomness into our games similar to that of a real NBA game."
